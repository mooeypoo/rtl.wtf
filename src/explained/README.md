# RTL Resources

Right-to-Left languages exist, but supporting them isn't always easy or straight forward. The mere attempt to do so, though, can improve both the user experience but also, generally, the UX of most applications &mdash; even those that do not have translations and are English-only.

Here you can get some general and specific information about Right-to-Left languages, the hardship, the history, advice and tips for support and how to improve your general UX by thinking about translation, accessibility, and Right-to-Left language support.

This section includes some explanations, demonstration and experiments that demonstrate RTL harships and solutions.
